- Objective: Implement a ubiquitous environment control application using Tuple Space, in which an interface must be provided to manage a set of environments, devices and users that can be inserted in these environments:
  - The environments must be named amb1, amb2, amb3, etc. Devices should be named by disp1, disp2, disp3, etc. Users must be nominator by user1, user2,user3, etc.
  - It must be possible to create environments, devices and users.
  - It must be possible to destroy environments that are empty.
  - It must be possible to list the devices and users that are in an environment.
  - It must be possible to move a device or a user from one environment to another.
  - Each environment can receive different devices and users.
  - Each device or user can only be in a single environment.
  - Users, within the same environment, can exchange messages with each other.

Environments, devices and users must be implemented as Tuples.
